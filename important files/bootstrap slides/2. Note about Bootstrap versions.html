<p>Hi <strong>Everyone</strong>!<br><br>In this section Colt will teach you Bootstrap 3.</p><p>Bootstrap nowÂ has a new version (4). Colt teaches version 3 in this section and version 4 in the next.</p><p>While working in this section, please use the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">original documentation</a> for version 3 and ensure that you're using version 3.3.7 in your code as you're following along with the lectures.</p><h4>Why teach both versions?</h4><p>Many companies still use version 3, so if you know both versions then you can easily help them migrate to version 4.</p><p>Also, the YelpCamp project in the back-end section of this course uses version 3, so if you don't know the version 3 syntax it will be more difficult to follow along.</p><p>Once you've completed the YelpCamp project, then you can use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHHh0sj1uKY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this guide</a> to upgrade your code from Bootstrap 3 to version 4.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks,<br>Ian<br><em>Course TA</em></p>
