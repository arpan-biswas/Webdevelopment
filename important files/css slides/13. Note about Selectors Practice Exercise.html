<p>Hi <strong class="redactor-inline-converted">Everyone</strong>!<br>In the next lecture you'll be asked to <em class="redactor-inline-converted">"Make all inputs have a 3px red border"</em>, this should say <em>"Make all inputs (except the checkboxes) have a 3px red border"</em>. Checkbox elements cannot be styled directly. If you're wondering how to style them, you can checkout <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4148499/how-to-style-checkbox-using-css" rel="nofollow">this StackOverflow thread</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, around the 1 minute and 40 second mark Colt mistakenly uses the CSS color property, but he should have used either the background or background-color property. He makes the correction in the solution video.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Ian<br><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Course TA</em> </p>
