<h4>Hi Everyone!</h4><p>Just so you don't get confused, around the 8 minute mark in the next video, Colt goes over the image sizing calculation. He mistakenly says "..each one of these [images] is 10%..", when he should have said "each one of these is 30%, making 90% total, plus 1.66% times 6 for the margins, which equals 99.96%" (nearly 100%).</p><p>Also, if you use images of varying dimensions then you may encounter some odd behavior in your grid. See <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/questions/2670526" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> for a solution.</p><p> </p><p>Cheers,<br>Ian<br><em>Course TA</em></p>
