<h4><strong>IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ!!!</strong></h4><p><br>Hi Everyone,</p><p>The following lecture, "CSS Colors" has a segment where the colors flash across the screen rather quickly.</p><p>If you're prone to photosensitive epilepsy (PSE) then please avoid watching the screen from the 1 minute and 7 second mark until the 1 minute and 54 second mark in the video.</p><p>Also, the lecture after that, "Background and Border", has some patterns/colors that could potentially give you trouble also, please view with caution.</p><p>thanks,<br>Ian</p>
