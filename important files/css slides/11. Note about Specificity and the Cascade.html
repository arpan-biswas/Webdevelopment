<h4>Hi Everyone!</h4><p>In the next lecture Colt will introduce the <a href="https://specificity.keegan.st/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Keegan Street Specificity Calculator</a>.</p><p>If you visit the website that he uses in the video you'll notice that the calculator has some slight changes.</p><p>It's still more or less the same, but now it reads from the top down, instead of left to right, and the inline-style value was removed.</p><p>If you want to see the official W3 spec. for calculating CSS specificity, then see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/#specificity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>-------<br>Thanks,<br>Ian</p>
