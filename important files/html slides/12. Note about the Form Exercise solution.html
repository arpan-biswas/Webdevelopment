<h4>Hi Everyone,<strong> </strong></h4><p>At the 12 minute and 15 second mark of the following Form Exercise SOLUTION video, there are two typos. Where the second and third <strong>select menus</strong> say "month=..." it should actually say "name=...", like the first select menu. So the code on lines <strong>46</strong> and <strong>53</strong> should be as follows:</p><p><code>&lt;select name="day"&gt;</code><br>and..<br><code>&lt;select name="year"&gt;</code><br></p><p>Meanwhile, some of you may have found the <strong>minlength</strong> and <strong>maxlength</strong> attributes to use for the input validation. This method has <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#Browser_compatibility" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">less browser support</a> than the pattern attribute.</p><p>Lastly, the way Colt has labeled the birthday inputs is semantically incorrect. Please see <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/questions/2348980" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> for a valid method of grouping multiple inputs, with labels, so they'll pass <a href="http://validator.w3.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">w3 validation</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>-------<br>Thanks,<br>Ian</p>
