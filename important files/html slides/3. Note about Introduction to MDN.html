<p>Hi <strong>Everyone</strong>!</p>

<p>The link in the next video, "Introduction to MDN" for MDN's Introduction to HTML can now be found <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>



<p>The MDN page has been updated since the making of this course so it won't appear exactly like what Colt has in the video. If you want to view the original version from when Colt recorded the video then see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151206134313/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction" rel="nofollow">here</a> for an archived version of the webpage before it was updated.</p>





<p>cheers,<br>Ian</p>
